what is grpc ? 
-------------
gRPC is a powerful framework for working with Remote Procedure Calls.  

RPCs allow you to write code as though it will be run on a local computer, even though it may be executed on another computer. 

follow below to install cmake and grpc.

How to build sample apps (grpc/examples/cpp/helloworld) ? 
--------------------------------------------------------
export "MY_INSTALL_DIR" (this is the directory where i have installed grpc and cmake) and "PATH" variables (this is the path where cmake binary is searched for) 

$ export MY_INSTALL_DIR=/home/divakar/grpc/grpc-a 

$ export PATH="$PATH:$MY_INSTALL_DIR/bin" 

$ echo $PATH 

/home/divakar/.local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin:/home/divakar/grpc/grpc-a/bin 

$ echo $MY_INSTALL_DIR 

/home/divakar/grpc/grpc-a 

Change to the exampleâ€™s directory: 

$ cd examples/cpp/helloworld 

Build the example using cmake: 

$ mkdir -p cmake/build 

$ pushd cmake/build 

$ cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$MY_INSTALL_DIR ../.. 

(you can pass "cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$MY_INSTALL_DIR -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON ../.." to enable make output to stduot , also it creates compile_commands.json which will have make commands in it) 

$ make 

(to see make output on scree do "make VERBOSE=1") 

Run the server: 

$ ./greeter_server
Server listening on 0.0.0.0:50051

$./greeter_client 
Greeter received: Hello world 


I have attached a sample client and server app to send and receive sensor data. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to run? 
----------
* $make all 

* Open a window and run server app 

$ ./sensor_server 
Server listening on port: 0.0.0.0:5000
 

* In another window run client app 

$ ./sensor_client 
response recieved from server
20
25
1

* Server-side o/p for above client query 

$ ./sensor_server 
Server listening on port: 0.0.0.0:5000
data recieved from client
name :Laboratory
temperature :43
humidity :35
door :0
